This repo contains 2 applications UI (Rails app built on top of relational DB) and API (which only talks to Redis)

First make sure you have Redis running on your dev box.  

UI:
cd ui
bundle
rake db:migrate && rake db:seed
look in seeds.rb for the random data that was generated
rails s -p 3001

browse to http://localhost:3001
login with admin@email.com / password
browse to http://localhost:3001/admin for basic RailsAdmin CRUD UI
browse to http://localhost:3001/sidekiq for Sidekiq UI

API
cd api
bundle
rails s

browse to http://localhost:3000/?kw=keyword1
you will see output like this: 
"{"title":"title2","body":"body2","cpc":8,"link":"http://localhost:3000/click?url=aHR0cDovL3dlYnNpdGUyLmNvbQ%3D%3D%0A"}",

browse to link URL and you will be redirected to website1-10.com
browse to http://localhost:3001/sidekiq/queues/click and you will see 1 click queued up to process.  
in UI app bash run "sidekiq" and it will process the click job
